Introduction
==================== 

##Overview of Data
To familiarize myself with the types of data that I am looking at, I first have to do some research.  The links below are great resources for learning about the chemical compositions of wine and what each chemical (or variable in this analysis) is.

http://www.wineskills.co.uk/winemaking/winemaking-knowledge-base/chemical-composition

http://waterhouse.ucdavis.edu/whats-in-wine/red-wine-composition

####What is the structure of your dataset?
There are 1,599 red wines observations on basis of 11 features like (fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar, chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, density, pH,sulphates, alcohol,quality ) the chemical properties of the wine. The max quality provided in the data set is 8.

Quality: quality has most values concentrated in the categories 5, 6 and 7. Only a small proportion is in the categories [3, 4] and [8] and none in the categories [1, 2]

pH value: is considered to be a key parameter for the determination of quality of wine and hence the analysis focussed on determining the impact of these pH values on final quality determination.

Alcohol content: Alcohol content is an important parameter to impact the quality.In this dara set alcohol has an irregular shaped distribution. With min 9.4 to max 14.90.

####What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main features in the data set are alcohol content, pH and total acidity level (volatile.acidity+fixed.acidity+citric.acid)) to determine the quality. I’d like to determine which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines. We can check the acidity level and other variables to build a predictive model to determine the red quality.

####What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
Free and total sulpher dioxide,citric.acid, fixed.acidity, and sulphates content likely contribute to the quality of the wine.We can find the correlation between the different variables to check which variable has high correlation with the quality.

####What is the structure of the dataset?
nrow(wine) and ncol(wine) can be used to test the number of observations and variables.  By running this piece of code we get the following output:
```{r wine data, echo=FALSE}
cat("There are", nrow(wine), "observations and", ncol(wine), "variables","\n")
```

str(wine) can be used to view the structure of the data.  This will tell us the format the data is in and we can use this information to help use structure the data for analysis.  
```{r wine structure, echo=FALSE}
print("The data structure for wine is:")
str(wine)
```
####What are the variables used in the dataset?
names(wine) can be used to observe the variables used in the dataset. The following variables are used in this dataset:
```{r wine variables, echo=FALSE}
print("The wine variables used in this study are:")
names(wine)
#summary(wine[2:13])
```

####Attribute information: 
1. fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).
2. volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
3. citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.
4. residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.
5. chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.
6. free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
7. total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
8. density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
9. pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine.
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10).

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

####Data sample
This dataset is pretty large, so it will not be very helpful to look at all the data at once in a spreadsheet.  We are going to have to use summarization techniques in R to make observations about this data.  We can quickly get a look at the structure of the data and the variables by veiwing the first few rows of the data in a tabulated format.  Here is a sample fo the first 5 rows of wine:
```{r sample of the data, echo=FALSE}
head(wine,5)
```

### Exploded Pie Chart
This pie chart provides an overview of the percantage that each variable represents in this dataset.  This chart provides a nice visual for looking at the variables contained in the dataset, but it doesn't give us much information of use.
```{r Exploded pie chart, echo=FALSE}
slices <- c(2,3, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13) 
lbls <- c("fixed.acidity","volatile.acidity","citric.acid" ,"residual.sugar","chlorides","free.sulfur.dioxide", "total.sulfur.dioxide","density","pH", "sulphates","alcohol","quality")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels 
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels 
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
   main="Pie Chart of Wine Variables in this Study")
```

##Statisitical Description:
Instead of using a chart, we can explore the variables in this dataset on a marco level using a statisical summary.  The summary below provides a description of each variable in the dataset.  This numerical tabulation is useful, because we can refer back to it when we perform more micro level analysis later, to help us maintain a general baseline for each variable we look at.
```{r wine summary, echo=FALSE}
print("The following is a statistical summary for red wine:")
summary(wine[2:13])
```

###Boxplots
A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”). It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed. This description has been sourced from https://towardsdatascience.com/ and can be found at: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51.  This tells us that we have some outlier data in all the  of variables.  This greatest number of outliers are in residual sugar, chlorides, fixed acidity, free sulfur dioxide, density, sulphates, pH, and volatile acidity.  
```{r visualize variability of each variable wine, echo=FALSE}
meltData <- melt(wine[2:13])
ggplot(meltData, aes(factor(variable), value))+ 
geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~variable, scale="free")
```

###Summarized Histograms
Just as R let's us summarize the data in simple graphs, like the boxplot above; we can also summarize the data in a group of histograms.  Below we can get a general since for skewness and distribution of the data.  We can see that some of the variables are skewed heavily to the right.  This could be due to extreme outliers.  pH and quality appear to be normally distributed.
```{r visualize distribution in variables wine, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(meltData, aes(x = value)) + 
facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free_x") + 
geom_histogram()
```


\newpage
Analysis
==================== 

We will begin with univariate analysis.  Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analysis and is focus on a single variable or data point.  It doesn't deal with causes or relationships (unlike regression) and it's major purpose is to describe; it takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data.  Because we performed the summaries above we could skip this step or abbreviate this step and only look at the most interesting data.  For the purpose of scrutinizing the information and demonstrating the use of R, I will run hisotgrms on each of the varibales.

##Univariate Analysis

Based on my readings, my top 4 variables of interest are summarized next.  We can see that pH appears to be normally distributed, but the remaining 3 data points are skewed.
```{r echo=FALSE, }
Wp1<-ggplot(aes(x=pH), data = wine)+
   geom_histogram(color =I('black'),fill = I('#B22222'))+
  ggtitle('pH')
  
Wp2<-ggplot(aes(x=residual.sugar),
       data =  wine)+
   geom_histogram(color =I('black'),fill = I('#B22222'))+
  ggtitle(' Sugar')

Wp3<-ggplot(aes(x=sulphates),
       data =  wine)+
   geom_histogram(color =I('black'),fill = I('#B22222'))+
  ggtitle('Sulphates')

Wp4<-ggplot(aes(x=alcohol),
       data =wine)+
   geom_histogram(color =I('black'),fill = I('#B22222'))+
  ggtitle('Alcohol')

grid.arrange(Wp1,Wp2,Wp3,Wp4,ncol=2)

```

The following histograms are provided for each variable:

###Quality 
```{r quality wine, echo=FALSE}
qplot(quality, main = "Wine", xlab = "Quality rating", ylab = "Count", binwidth = .5, data=wine, fill=I('#B22222'),col=I("#000000"))
```
```{r summary wine quality, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$quality)
paste("sd", sd(wine$quality))
```
The distribution of quality appears to be normal with many wines at average quality (4-5) and fewer wines at low quality and high quality. We can see that the median and mean both hover near 6.0.  The standard deviation is about .81.

###Alcohol content
```{r alcohol wine, echo=FALSE}
qplot(alcohol, main = "Wine", xlab = "Quality rating", ylab = "Count", binwidth = .25, data=wine, fill=I('#B22222'), col=I("#000000"))
```

```{r summary wine alcohol, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$alcohol)
paste("sd", sd(wine$alcohol))
```
The alcohol concentration distribution is right skewed. There is a tight concentration of of values between 9.5 and 11.  The median and mean hover around 10.20 and 10.42.  We can see that the standard deviation is just over 1.

###Volatile.acidity  
```{r volatile acidity wine, echo=FALSE}
qplot(volatile.acidity, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Volatility rating", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .01 ,col=I("#000000"))
```

```{r summary volatile acidity wine, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$volatile.acidity)
```
We can see that volatility acidity distribution is right skewed.  Outliers between .99 ad 1.6 are clearly visible.

###Citric.acid  

```{r citric acid, echo=FALSE}
qplot(citric.acid, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Citrict acid rating", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .01, col=I("#000000"))
```
```{r summary citric acid,  echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$citric.acid)
```
Most wines have 0 $g/dm^3$ of citric acid. The distribution is right skewed with some ups and downs. We can see peaks at 0.250 and 0.500 which may hint at some bimodal behavior. A single wine appears far away on the right side with 1 $g/dm^3$ of citric acid.

### residual.sugar

```{r residual sugar, echo=FALSE}
qplot(residual.sugar, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Sugar rating", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .3, col=I("#000000"))
```

```{r summary residual sugar, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$residual.sugar)
```
The distribution of residual sugar has a median value of 2.2. The distribution is right skewed with a long tail in the right side. There are many small bars on the right side of the main peak.

###pH 
```{r pH, echo=FALSE}
qplot(pH, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "pH rating", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .01, col=I("#000000"))

```

```{r summary pH, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$pH)
```
The distribution seems symmetrical or could be also considered bimodal with both peaks very close to each other. There seems to be a local maximum at around 3.2 and then another one at 3.35.  The median value is 3.31, and most wines have a pH between 3.21 and 3.4.

###density

```{r density, echo=FALSE}
qplot(density, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Density", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .001, col=I("#000000"))

```
```{r summary density, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$density)
```
The density of wines varies few, with most of the values between 0.9956 and 0.9967. The distribution is almost symmetric and has median value of 0.9968. The density if close to the density of water (1 $g/cm^3$ at 4 $^\circ C$).

###chlorides

```{r chlorides, echo=FALSE, }
qplot(chlorides, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Chloride", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth = .01, col=I("#000000"))+ xlim(.012, .2)
```

```{r summary chlorides, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$chlorides)
```
The amount of chlorides in the wines has a median value of 0.079 $g/dm^3$. The distribution with looks normal around its main peak but has a very long right tail, with small counts of wines with values until 0.611 $g/dm^3$

###free.sulfur.dioxide 
```{r free sulfur dioxide, echo=FALSE}
qplot(free.sulfur.dioxide, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Free Sulfur Dioxide", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), binwidth=10, col=I("#000000"))
```
```{r summary free sulfur dioxide, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$free.sulfur.dioxide)
```

The distribution of free sulfur dioxide concentrations is right skewed. The median value is 14 $mg/dm^3$. The right tail extends until a maximum of 72 with a gap between 57 and 66.

### total.sulfur.dioxide

```{r total sulfur dioxide, echo=FALSE}
qplot(total.sulfur.dioxide, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Total Sulfur Dioxide", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), col=I("#000000"))
```

```{r summary total sulfur dioxide, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$total.sulfur.dioxide)
```
The distribution of total sulfur dioxide is right skewed with a median value of 38 $mg/dm^3$. On the right tail we can see a local maximum near 80. There's a gap between 165 and 278 with only two wines with a concentration greater than or equal to 278.

###sulphates

```{r sulphates, echo=FALSE}
qplot(sulphates, data=wine, main = "Wine", xlab = "Sulphates", ylab = "Count", fill=I('#B22222'), col=I("#000000"))
```

```{r summary sulphates, echo=FALSE}
summary(wine$sulphates)
```
The distribution of sulphates is slightly right skewed. Some outliers on the right tail have around 2 g/dm^3 of sulphates.
The median value of sulphates is 0.62 and most wines have a concentration between 0.55 and 0.73.

##Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis is the simultaneous analysis of two variables (attributes). It explores the concept of relationship between two variables, whether there exists an association and the strength of this association, or whether there are differences between two variables and the significance of these differences. -https://www.saedsayad.com/bivariate_analysis.htm

The first analysis we will start with is a correlation matrix.  This gives us a quick view of relationships between the variables.
```{r echo=FALSE}
#ggpairs(wine, columns = c(2:13), columnLabels = c("f.acidity", "v.acidity", "c.acid", "res.sugar", "chlorides", "free.SO2", "total.SO2", "density", "pH", "sulphates", "alcohol","quality")) + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8))
ggscatmat(wine, columns = 2:13) + theme_grey(base_size=7)
```
A correlation coefficient is a number between −1 and +1 calculated so as to represent the linear dependence of two variables or sets of data.  We can see here that there are no variables that are -1 or +1.  

The top 4 positive correlation coefficients are:

* citric acid:fixed acidity = .67
* density:fixed acidty = .67
* alcohol:quality = 0.48

The biggest negative corrlation coefficients are:

* pH:fixed acidty = -0.68
* volatile acidity:citric acid = -0.55
* pH:citric acid = -0.54

Below we can look at these relationships in a bit more detail.  
citric acid and fixed acidity:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(citric.acid, fixed.acidity)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

This chart shows that as citric acid increases than fixed acidity increases.

Fixed acidity and density:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(fixed.acidity, density)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

This chart shows that fixed acidity increase as density increases.

Fixed alcohol and quality:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(quality,alcohol)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +  
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

And finaly, quality increases with alcohol.

Now let's look at negative correlations:
We are going to list all of these at once, as we would expect negative relatoinships to show inverse plots.
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(pH,fixed.acidity)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +  
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(volatile.acidity,citric.acid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +  
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(pH,citric.acid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +  
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x=alcohol, fill=factor(quality))) + 
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)
```

This chart provides a different perspective on correlation.  We can see that alcohol content around 5-8 seems to have the highest quality rating.

Here are the summary statistics for alcohol content at each quality level:
```{r echo=FALSE}
by(wine$alcohol, factor(wine$quality), summary)
```

##Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis is a set of techniques used for analysis of data sets that contain more than one variable, and the techniques are especially valuable when working with correlated variables.

In this section we will visualize the relationship between my top 4 variables of interest, which are sugar, alcohol, sulphates and pH:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x=residual.sugar, y=alcohol, size = alcohol, 
                 color=factor(quality))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_brewer()
```

Let's try summarize using a contour plot:
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x = alcohol, y = residual.sugar, 
                 colour=factor(wine$quality))) + 
  geom_density2d(bins=2) + 
  scale_color_brewer() + 
  geom_point(color="black", alpha=0.1) 
```
This chart shows that higher quality wines ten to have higher levels of alcohol in them, but sugar remains most concentrated between 1.5 and 2.  So dry wines appear to be the highest quality vs. alcohol.  Outliers exist in this dataset.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x = sulphates, y = residual.sugar, 
                 colour=factor(wine$quality))) + 
  geom_density2d(bins=2) + 
  scale_color_brewer() + 
  geom_point(color="black", alpha=0.1) 
```
This shows higher quality wines tend to have sulphates between .5 and 1.0 and sugars below 4, but above 1.5.
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x = residual.sugar, y = pH, 
                 colour=factor(wine$quality))) + 
  geom_density2d(bins=2) + 
  scale_color_brewer() + 
  geom_point(color="black", alpha=0.1) 
```
This shows heavy concentraiton of pH between 3.2 and 3.5 vs. sugar content. Clear outliers can be identified in this dataset.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(x = alcohol, y = pH, 
                 colour=factor(wine$quality))) + 
  geom_density2d(bins=2) + 
  scale_color_brewer() + 
  geom_point(color="black", alpha=0.1) 
```

This shows higer quality wines tend to have alcohol content between 10.5 and 13.5 and pH levels between 3.2 and 3.5.

Final Plots and Summary
==================== 

###Reflections
This project was a good opportunity to apply R statisical analysis and utilize R visualization capabilities.  Also, this eexercise provides a good example of how a script could be used to analyze multiple sets of data.  This same code strcuture could be used to analyze the white wine dataset.

###Challenges
My first challenge was understanding the dataset.  Because I am not familiar with wine or chemistry, I had to read about the wine data in other sources to udnerstand what plots were meaningful and what variables could be compared.  Another challenge I faced was deciding what plots, stats, and other analytics were useful for this project.  Thsi project could quickly become overloaded with analytics that could clutter and reduce the overal value of the end product.  Adding color to plots became and important attirubte to helping distinguish variables.  

###Recommendations
If time were given, I would run the white wine dataset through the same plots and analysis to see what the result would be.  I would then compare the white wine and red wine results to see what difference occur between the two types of wine.  If provide, another interesting dataset to intersect with this analysis would be sales data on red and white wines.  I would like to see if certain mixes of variables sell better than others and at what price points.  Is there really a difference between a cheap wine and an expensive wine and can we quantity what that difference is?
